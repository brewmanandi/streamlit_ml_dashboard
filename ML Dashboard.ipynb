Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled\\nis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

This article\\nwill provide the essential information for doing so on standard\\nUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups\\nare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com\\nfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive\\nmailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can\\nlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the\\nUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)\\n\\nFirst of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,\\nor 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also\\nimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems\\nlike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you\\nhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is\\nprobably not good enough.\\n\\nListserv:\\n\\nThere is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which\\nis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of\\nthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this\\narticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should\\nprobably  look at listserv carefully.\\n\\nThe Alias file:\\n\\nOn a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on\\nwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:\\n\\nfoo:   bar, baz, bletch\\n\\n\\nwhich means that any email sent the name `foo\\' on that host is\\nredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest\\npossible email list is \\n\\nmy-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that\\nyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can\\ndo the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:\\n\\nmy-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list\\nmy-favorite-car-request: my-address\\n\\nWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated\\naddresses.  This file can be in the list admin\\'s home directory,\\nowned by the list admin.\\n\\nBounced Mail:\\n\\nthis still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the\\nmembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.\\nTherefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up\\nis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,\\nby the way.

Drugs are very illegal and they\\'re\\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don\\'t.\\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\\nheavily patrolled) then I really can\\'t accept that argument.\\n\\n>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:\\n>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!\\n\\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.

However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\\nhalf the per-car death rate.\\n\\n>The issue (I hope..):\\n>I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.\\n>Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is....

The\\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\\nirrelevent.\\n\\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I\\'d suggest, then, that the murderous\\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\\n\\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\\n\\n>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them\\n>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,\\n>it\\'s the \\'axer\\' ??\\n>(An example, don\\'t flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)\\n\\n\\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \\nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe\\'s\\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don\\'t really think we\\'ve got\\nmore knives or fists.  \\n\\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\\nare doing, you won\\'t solve your problem.  And if the problem is \\nviolent crime, you shouldn\\'t concentrate on the tools instead.  The\\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).

If this were\\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat\\'l Commission on the Causes and\\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\\n\\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\\n\\n\\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\\n\\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \\n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \\n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \\n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \\n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\\n\\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I\\'m not\\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\\ndon\\'t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\\n\\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\\n\\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\\nstandard: the FBI\\'s Unified Crime Report.\\n\\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\\n\\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\\n\\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\\nin Vancouver.\\n\\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\\nearlier findings.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\\n\\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\\ninterval, Vancouver\\'s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\\n\\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\\nSeattle apparently didn\\'t enjoy relief from any crime category\\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\\nself-defense.\\n\\n\\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\\n\\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\\n\\n\\tJohn H.

I won the battle but \\nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \\ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \\nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \\nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \\nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \\nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \\nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \\ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \\nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \\nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \\nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \\na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet\\'s \\nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \\npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \\nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\\n\\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \\ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \\nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \\nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \\nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \\nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \\nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \\na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \\nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \\nfor my insurance.\\n\\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \\nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \\nthat required attention included the transmission, \\nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \\nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \\ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \\nleast four attempts.\\n\\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \\nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \\npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \\nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\\n\\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\\n\\n',\n",

The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and \\nevents are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...\\n\\nWALTER M. MILLER, JR\\n\\n\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\"\\nOne gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives\\ncopying blueprints from \"Saint Leibowitz\", filling the sheets of paper with\\nink and leaving white lines and letters.\\n\\nEDGAR PANGBORN\\n\\n\"Davy\"\\nPost atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example,\\nforbids that anyone \"produce, describe or use any substance containing...\\natoms\". \\n\\nPHILIP K. DICK\\n\\nPhilip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one\\ntrue version.\\n\\n                             Books -- Non-fiction\\n\\nPETER DE ROSA\\n\\n\"Vicars of Christ\", Bantam Press, 1988\\nAlthough de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very\\nenlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc.\\n(German translation: \"Gottes erste Diener.

Contains an outstanding\\nappendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious\\narea.  Argues both for \"negative atheism\" (i.e. the \"non-belief in the\\nexistence of god(s)\") and also for \"positive atheism\" (\"the belief in the\\nnon-existence of god(s)\").  Includes great refutations of the most\\nchallenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting\\ncontempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.\\n541 pages.

Examines the way in which\\nunbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative\\nworld-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France\\nand Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England\\ndevelopments.  \"Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,\\nWithout God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate\\nof a single idea, the belief that God exists.\" \\n316 pages.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A.

I\\'ll continue to re-post periodically until\\n*** he answers them, publicly indicates that he won\\'t answer them,\\n*** stops posting to alt.atheism, the alt.atheism community tells\\n*** me to stop, or I get totally bored.  I apologize for the \\n*** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach, but I\\'m at a loss\\n*** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and \\n*** seeming intellectual dishonesty.\\n***\\n*** This is re-post #3.\\n\\n\\nCharley,\\n\\nI can\\'t help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers\\nto substantive questions that have been raised in response to your\\nprevious posts.  I submit that you don\\'t answer them because you\\ncannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once\\nagain challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for\\nyou as possible, I\\'ll present concise re-statements of some of the\\nquestions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may\\naddress them one at a time for all to see.\\n\\nShould you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I\\nwill re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at\\nsuch time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat\\nthis procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or\\nyou cease to post to this newsgroup.\\n\\nI would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these\\nquestions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be\\nkind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too\\npleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it\\nfrom this list.\\n\\nNow, to the questions...\\n\\n1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological\\npatterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating\\nthat you weren\\'t referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some\\natheists who you feel don\\'t fit your patterns, to show that you indeed\\nwere not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed\\nto do so.  Please do so now.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your\\nstereotype?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n>>> This is not true for everyone on this board, and you are out of line\\n>>> in assuming that it is.\\n>>\\n>>YOU, however, deleted the text further along where I said that I didn\\'t mean\\n>>to imply that everybody\\'s experience was along the same lines.  \\n>\\n>Whether or not you *mean* to make such implications, you do so\\n>repeatedly.  \\n>\\n>Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint: can you name\\n>those atheists that you\\'ve come across who *do not* fit into the\\n>patterns that you theorize?\\n\\n\\n2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \"senses and\\nreason are all we have to go by\", and when pressed, you have implied\\nthat we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly\\nasked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both\\nexperience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses\\nand reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can\\nexperience and interpret it without using senses and inherent\\nreasoning?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n>>Revelation is not reason, and if we DO have revelation, then\\n>>reasoning is NOT all we have.\\n\\n>First, show me that revelation exists.  Second, if revelation is not\\n>perceived through the senses, how exactly is it perceived?  According\\n>to my Webster\\'s, revelation is \"an act of revealing or communicating\\n>divine truth.\"  Now, tell me how such a thing can be revealed/\\n>communicated other than via the senses?  Tell me how you can interpret\\n>this revelation other than with reason, that is, using your brain to\\n>interpret what you are sensing.  When I say there is no way for a\\n>human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as\\n>interpreted by reason (your brain), it is because this is the simple\\n>truth.  If you have another mechanism of interface, by all means,\\n>share it with us.\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>>>You CANNOT escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is\\n>>>our senses and our reason, period.\\n>>\\n>>Again, this is indefensible.  \\n>\\n>No, it is simple truth.  I challenge you to show me otherwise.\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>>Few mystics will agree to this assertion, and the common defense of\\n>>redefining \"senses\" to absorb (for instance) mystical experiences is\\n>>begs the question of whether some senses are better than others.\\n>\\n>I allow you the broadest definition of senses, to make things easier\\n>for you.  Now, show me that \"mystical experiences\" exist.  Remember,\\n>you aren\\'t allowed to go by testimony of others (e.g., mystics), since\\n>you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable - you know, tainted by\\n>my own bias.  Further, once these mystical thingies are absorbed, show\\n>me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of\\n>interpretation via that person\\'s reasoning capabilities.\\n>\\n>I challenge you to show me these things.  If you cannot do so, you\\n>might as well give up the fight.\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>Let me reiterate, you have NOT explained your interpretation of your\\n>experiences, so it is not possible for me to have attacked them.  In\\n>point of fact, I specifically challenged you to explain this\\n>revelation stuff that you were talking about, and I note for the\\n>record that you appear to have declined my challenge.\\n>\\n>*What* is it?  *How* is it sensed?  *How* is it interpreted?  And\\n>*how* does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit\\n>of our senses and reasoning abilities?  You have answered none of\\n>these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims.  If you\\n>can\\'t answer them, your claims are entirely specious.\\n\\n\\n3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by\\na.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify\\none such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do\\nso now.\\n\\nQuestion: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and\\nfantastical?  If so, please repeat them.\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n\\n>>I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent (if wrong :-))\\n>>posting.  \\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>>Likewise, the reference to \"unverifiable, fantastical\\n>>claims\" represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to\\n>>dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group.\\n>\\n>Give me your address and I\\'ll be pleased to send you a dictionary.\\n>Failing that, can you name ONE claim that I have made that is in any\\n>sense unverifiable or fantastical?  I demand that you retract this\\n>statement if you cannot offer up evidence.  If you follow your usual\\n>pattern of ignoring the challenge, then you are simply an asshole.\\n\\n\\n4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as\\na result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the\\n\"axioms\" of reason that one couldn\\'t help but become atheist.  I asked\\nyou to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement\\nthat the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that\\nI have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer\\nthe question.  Please do so now.\\n\\nQuestion: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become\\natheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that\\neffect?  If you don\\'t retract that claim, do you retract the\\nsubsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably\\nresult in atheism?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n[First quote]\\n>>...we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is\\n>>based on reason... it is up to atheists to prove it to me...\\n>\\n>then,\\n>\\n[Second quote]\\n>>...but I do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with\\n>>an atheistic point of view.\\n\\n\\n5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these\\nChallenges because they contained too much in the way of \"included\\ntext\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn\\'t\\nrespond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify\\nthis seeming contradiction.\\n\\nQuestion:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context\\nfrom your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to\\navoid \"included text\"?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\nFirst you said:\\n\\n>>My ordinary rules are that I don\\'t read articles over over 150 lines\\n>>or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first\\n>>screen.  THese are not rules of morality, but practicality.\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n>>If someone is not going to argue with MY version of MY position, then\\n>>they cannot be argued with.\\n\\n\\nAs usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.\\n\\n--Dave Wood\\n\\n\\np.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley\\'s responses to\\nthese challenges to date.\\n\\n3/18/93\\n>>This makes no sense to me at all; it gives the appearance either of utter\\n>>incoherence, or of answering some question of Mr. Wood\\'s imagination.\\n\\n3/31/93 (#1)\\n>>Mr. Wood, I do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on\\n>>the net requires any response whatsoever.

Also, there\\'s a lot of glass\\naround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\\nthe heat.  I\\'ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren\\'t available when I got the car so\\nI can\\'t comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \\nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren\\'t meant for snow, and the seats assume\\nthat you\\'re not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \\ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \\nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they\\'re rigid plastic\\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD\\'s max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\\nbut that\\'s it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\\n\\nLastly, don\\'t store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \\nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\\n\\nNathan\\nnathan@sco.com\\n\\n>\\n>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n>|Jeremy Mereness                 | Support     | Ye Olde Disclaimer:    |\\n>|zonker+@cmu.edu (internet)      |    Free     |  The above represent my|\\n>| FAST Project, CMU-GSIA         |     Software|   opinions, alone.     |\\n>|B.S.

       " \"From: ndallen@r-node.hub.org (Nigel Allen)\\nSubject: WACO: Clinton press conference, part 1\\nOrganization: R-node Public Access Unix - 1 416 249 5366\\nLines: 282\\n\\nHere is a press release from the White House.\\n\\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\\n To: National Desk\\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President \\nClinton in a question and answer session with the press:\\n\\n1:36 P.M. EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\\nstandoff ensued.\\n\\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\\ninsane.\\n\\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\\nagents against the compound.\\n\\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the decision.\\n\\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\\nhas been learned now.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\\nwith --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\\n\\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\\nI was given were the following:\\n\\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\\nmembers to come out.\\n\\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\\nthe passage of time.\\n\\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\\nsignificance.\\n\\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\\ntoday.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\\nto unfold.\\n\\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\\nchildren.\\n\\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\\ndecide that way?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\\nevidence we have.\\n\\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\\njust began to spin downward.\\n\\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\\nhave gas masks?\\n\\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\\ncountry.\\n\\n   (more, more)\\n -30-\\n\",\n",

As his guilt has not been established, it is\\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\\n\\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \\ndistinction.\\n\\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu\\'min\", or \"true believer\" in\\nIslam.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n\\n',\n",

Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it\\'s M-16 now to\\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\\n\\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\\n\\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\\n  the trigger again.\\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\\n  to rotate to the next round.\\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\\n  easy motion, even one handed.\\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\\n\\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it\\'s jammed!\" before starting to do anything\\n  about clearing it.\\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \\n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\\n  of employment as a revolver.\\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\\n\\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received.

Turn off COPS and Hunter\\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\\n\\nGun control is hitting what you aim at.

The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction.

Hence big cooling towers.  \\n\\n>       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\\n>usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\\n>way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\\n>rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \\n>pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \\n\\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \\nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\\nnormally water\\'s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \\nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \\nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \\n\\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \\ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \\nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\\ncosts.  \\n\\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \\nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \\ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \\nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\\ncondenser area.\\n\\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\\npressure.\\n\\n>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is \\n>purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when\\n>the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than \\n>cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\\n\\nTrue.

The scenario you outline is reasonably \\nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we\\'ve been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n>                             God created the original genetic code\\n>perfect and without flaw.

In addition, their\\n>sin caused them to come under the dominion of Satan, who then assumed\\n>dominion over the earth...\\n[deletions]\\n>Since humanity was no longer under God\\'s protection but under Satan\\'s\\n>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\n Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) \\'started off\\'\\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\\ncollective sense.

It is a bad combination.\\n\\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn\\'t do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants \\'overgrazed\\',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I\\'m an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer.

I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who\\'s making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\\n>humanity forsook God\\'s protection.\\n\\n Here\\'s another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by \\'perfect\\' in the\\nphrase, \\'created... perfect and without flaw\\'? To my mind, a \\'perfect\\'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A \\'perfect\\' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer\\'s glue? That is, the\\noriginal genetic \\'instructions\\' were perfect, but were \\'written\\' in\\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\\nof did It just choose not to?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.\\n\\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn\\'t any evidence for\\nthe explanation you give.

(This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren\\'t atheists - don\\'t they contradict\\n  your point?

An atheist\\n doesn\\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\\'t exist, he/she may\\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\\'s the example:\\n \\n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\\n\\n Weak atheism   - \"I don\\'t believe in a god\"       a negative belief\\n \\n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\\'s look at it this way (in sets)\\n \\n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:\\n \\n christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god\\n \\n atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)\\n \\n atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set\\n \\n agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E\\', ....) \\n\\n\\n>\\tWhy are people so afraid to say \"undecided\"?

It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\nhave little theological import.\\n\\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\\nmaterial, but so far this hasn\\'t happened.\\n\\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\\nOT, unlike for the NT.\\n-- \\nC.

The biggest device can shift 60W with an\\nefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my\\ncar battery in about half an hour).\\n\\nUnfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic\\nspecs as a heat pump.

The\\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\n     Q  What federal laws --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\\n\\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\\nwhere they could be protected.\\n\\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\\n\\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\\n\\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\\n\\n     Thank you.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\\nAnd I do support her.\\n\\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\\npeople; I am.

It is very unlikely, however,\\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\\n\\nNot possible either.  You\\'d need about a 300 amp alternator for\\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\\n\\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \\n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \\n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \\n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\\n\\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\\n\\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \\ncause of your troubles,  and you\\'ll get better cooperation\\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \\n\\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\\nToo bad they don\\'t require the consumer equipment makers\\nto take any precautions.\\n\\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\\nCB\\'ers probably won\\'t sign (I don\\'t know that they\\'re even required\\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\nDouglas S.

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \\nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\\nmind...\\n\\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\\nintended for.\\n\\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\\nkill by their leaders.\\n\\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \\n\\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\\nparts of Man's history.@\\n\\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\\n\\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\\n\\n-ciao\\n\\n-chris blask\\n\",\n",

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n\\n-- \\nRobert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project\\t\\nInternet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research Institute\\nUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of Toronto\\nBitnet:\\t  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA\\n',\n",

If\\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \\nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\\n\\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \\nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" \\nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\\n\\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\\n\\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?\\n\\n==============================================================================\\nRandy T.

All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

That theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not\\nan argument in theism\\'s favor.

And yet, it is this\\n>very same argument from incredulity which ranks high among reasons\\n>why atheists (in general) reject God and in particular the Christian God.\\n\\n Not im my experience.

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\\n\\nI don\\'t know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the \\'lords\\' and other elites\\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn\\'t feel the\\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn\\'t be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\\nIts the old \\'might makes right\\' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\\ngovernment going rogue:  They don\\'t like it? Tough. We will simply\\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\\n\\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn\\'t\\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn\\'t fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\\n\\nUnbelievable.\\n\\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\\ngunfire, including 50\\'s tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".

By the finish of the Clinton administration, your\\n:RKBA will be null and void.

The number of\\n:cases of firearms abuses has ruined your cause. There is nothing you\\n:can do about it. Those who live by the sword shall die by it. \\n\\nThen the criminals who live by murder shall die by it.  Honest, law-abiding\\ncitizens need have no fear on that count.

The press\\nis against us, for its own selfish motivations.  And the people will soon\\nrealize the depths of deceit being spread by that media, and nullify its\\nill-directed power.  The People are with us.\\n\\n:Surrender your arms. Soon enough, officers will be around to collect\\n:them. Resistance is useless. They will overwhelm you - one at a time.\\n:Your neighbors will not help you.

In a gas 350\\nengine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about\\n$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long\\nand gets about 50% better mileage.

If you have an idea about its voltage and current \\nratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with \\nanything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating \\nof approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely \"ON\" \\nat +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they\\'re more or \\nless voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is \\nused as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to \\nexperiment with various gain-altering techniques.\\n\\nBill Willis     willisw@coe-nw.clemson.edu\\n(803) 656-5550\\n',\n",

It\\'s one\\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I\\'m sure, is that when people\\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\\n\\n       Unfortunately, that\\'s not the way things stack up.  The majority\\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \\nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \\nthemselves.  And why it\\'s popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\\nthe evidence doesn\\'t support this.  Internal studies, as well as\\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\\npeople jump off buildings.)\\n\\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \\nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn\\'t mean they\\nweren\\'t trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\\nkid might.\\n\\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there\\'s an enormous\\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\\nkilled.\\n\\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\\nbusinesses.)\\n\\n>Studies by the \\n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\\n\\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can\\'t comment.  I\\nwill point out Canada\\'s and Japan\\'s suicide rate as indications that\\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\\n\\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\\nit\\'s worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \\nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the\\nTreasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau\\'s priorities\\nwere aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-\\ngally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to\\nbe used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently\\nmade great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-\\ntation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before\\nBATF\\'s Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence\\nwas submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF\\ngun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither\\ncriminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into\\nunknowning technical violations.\\n \\n( Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT\\n     T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S\\n                                REPORT\\n                                of the\\n                   SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION\\n                                of the\\n                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\\n                         UNITED STATES SENATE\\n                        NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\\n                            SECOND SESSION\\n                             FEBRUARY, 1982\\n        Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\\n88-618 O\\n                        WASHINGTON : 1982\\n \\n \\nLetter to Constituent: April 1993\\n \\n \\nThank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\\nand Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with\\njurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.\\n \\nIt has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations\\nSubcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which\\nfunds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly\\nprofessional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.\\nThe agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in\\nsuccessful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use\\nof firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It\\nenforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory\\nminimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an\\nillegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in\\npreventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk\\nyouth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known\\ngangs from access to weapons.\\n \\nThe Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF\\non the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession\\n(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs\\nand other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to\\ntrace weapons through its\\' National Firearms Tracing Center, where\\nthey keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF\\nis the Federal governments\\' firearms expert and routinely works with\\nstate and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state\\nand local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys\\' office\\nfelt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally\\nestablish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and\\nthorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members\\nof the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a\\nSunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would\\nbe separated from the women and children and not in the area where\\nit was known that the illegal weapons were stored.\\n \\nAs you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh\\nspiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending\\nexecution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the\\nelement of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and\\nprepare for ATFs\\' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation\\npresented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the\\nFBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military\\ntanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and\\nfirepower of the Branch Davidians.\\n \\nBased on what I have learned about ATF\\'s role in the Branch Davidian\\nraid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply\\nsaddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who\\nattempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the\\ncult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a\\nthorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside\\nthe Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for\\nEnforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its\\' own review of the\\nWaco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the\\nevaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick\\nand peaceful conclusion.\\n \\nSincerely,\\n \\nDennis DeConcini\\nChairman\\nSubcommittee on Treasury,\\nPostal Service and\\nGeneral Government\\n \\nApril 7, 1993\\n \\n-- \\nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\\n',\n",

For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims \\n>for following the Quran. \\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n>Your idea is baseless from historical\\n>facts, it is a poor utopia, \\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n>while my ideas are derived from social\\n>and economic history. \\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n>My solution to all Muslims is simple:\\n>CUT THE CRAP, \\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT \\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE\\n>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.

Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.

If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.

The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small\\nsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so\\nthe salespeople wouldn\\'t give her the \"bimbo\" treatment.\\nHer first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan\\nSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what \"we\"\\nwanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid\\nkept playing the \"let me run this price by the sales manager\".  After\\nplaying the \"good salesman, bad salesman\" game, we finally told him\\nthat if he didn\\'t have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps\\nwe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in\\nthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick\\nin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton\\'s \"Don\\'t Get Taken Every Time\" for a\\nlist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of \"you\\'ll have to\\nwork with us on this price\", also known as \"each time you come up a\\nthousand dollars we\\'ll come down ten\", the salesmanager gave a signal to\\nhis two sales cronies, stood up, and said \"well, we can\\'t come down any\\nmore so I guess we can\\'t help you\" and they trouped out of the room,\\nleaving us sitting in the salesman\\'s office all by ourselves.  Hmm.\\nI\\'d read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he\\'d announced\\nthat our business was over, he shouldn\\'t care, and every time I tried\\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\\nbegins to berate us again.  We say that we won\\'t bother him anymore,\\nwe\\'re going next door to the Nissan dealership.\\n\\nThen comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out\\nthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,\\ncustomers and all, \"Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!\"\\nSo my friend bought a Sentra.\\n\\nJust so the guilty won\\'t go unpunished, I\\'ll mention that the\\nsales manager\\'s name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his\\nrefusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the\\nend, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was\\na young novice) that he\\'d be able to get at least X dollars out of\\nus, and he was steamed that we wouldn\\'t fall for his slimy tricks.\\n',\n",

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  \\nthe powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  \\nof the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  \\noil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  \\nthe turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  \\nsteam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  \\nsomething else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  \\ntype of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  \\nunobjectionable).

If the number is odd,\\nthen it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which\\nmay make you headache.\\n\\nThe second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and\\nall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the\\nsuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside.

A reference station\\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \\nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \\nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\\nunit.\\n\\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\\nwhich has stations all across the US.\\n\\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn P.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven\\'t seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.

It\\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn\\'t cost you much.  On\\nthe other hand, I\\'ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\\nyears.  For example, I\\'ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\\n\\nI\\'ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\\n\\nMost revolvers are more \\'fragile\\' then semi auto\\'s.  There are all sorts\\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\\'re out of the fight.\\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\\ninto that category.\\n\\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\\'s \"The Semi\\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\\n\\nIn general, I\\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\\n\\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\\nisn\\'t going to train them, they aren\\'t going to take the time on their\\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\\'t bother.\\n\\nFor myself, I\\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\\'d rather pick\\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\\'m wearing that day\\nand so on.

Particularly if a Republican administration had been\\nbehind it.  What\\'s going on here?\\n\\nLet\\'s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\\nI\\'m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\\nbecause I\\'ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\\'s behavior was\\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\\'s religious\\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\\n\\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\\'s attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\\'s major concern was the biblical\\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet\\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)

It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\\n\\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\\nanything that\\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\\'d like to\\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\\n\\n\\n[7]  What\\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?\\n\\nMost people don\\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\\nday timing cycle and so forth.\\n\\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\\noff ;-)\\n\\nThanks again everyone...\\n\\n-=-= Wes =-=-\\n\",\n",

As far as I'm concerned, there's no\\n  amp which can touch it at the price range.\\nThe build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other \\n  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid\\n  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.\\nIf you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components \\n  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect\\n  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each\\n  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are\\n  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.\\n\\nI was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east\\n  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components\\n  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the\\n  amplifiers sound so brilliant.\\nI cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with\\n  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly\\n  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\\n\\nMy last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like\\n  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded\\n  like new.\\n\\nIf you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will\\n  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.\\n\\nJust my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.\\n\\n--\\n***********************************************************************\\n**    Alan Webber                                                    **\\n**                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          **\\n**                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          **\\n**                                                                   **\\n** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **\\n** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **\\n** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **\\n** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    **\\n***********************************************************************\\n\",\n",

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\\nthem, So:\\n\\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \\nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\\nthe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more\\nstable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...\\nas I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new\\ncapacitor will \\'smooth\\' this out.\\n\\nand\\n2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to\\nbe placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out\\nthe 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !\\n\\n  I\\'ve not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH\\nof a distraction....

But one is also connected to every\\ngrounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,\\nwhile the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged\\ninto isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens\\nto accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,\\nthe main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it\\nuntil the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated\\nground will remain relatively noise-free.\\n',\n",

There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\\nbasis or empirical evidence.

Even when we agree to take someone elses\\nword \"on faith\", we just mean that having found this person to be\\nreliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.\\nIf we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence\\neverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about\\ngods?\\n \\nThe difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then\\none of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,\\nrather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith\\nis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\\nknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than\\ntheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other\\nknowledge.

If\\n\\tyou\\'re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don\\'t\\n\\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\\n\\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\\n\\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\\n\\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\\n\\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\\n\\twith the electrical code, but we don\\'t quote sections\\n\\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we\\'re wrong,\\n\\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\\n\\n\\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\\n\\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\\n\\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\\n\\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\\n\\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\\n\\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\\n\\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\\n\\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\\n\\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\\n\\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\\n\\trules.\\n\\n\\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\\n\\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\\n\\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\\n\\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\\n\\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\\n\\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we\\'ve\\n\\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC\\'\\' or\\n\\t``CEC\\'\\'.\\n\\n\\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\\n\\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\\n\\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\\n\\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\\n\\tIt\\'s revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\\n\\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\\n\\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There\\'s the\\n\\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There\\'s an abridged\\n\\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\\n\\tAnd there\\'s the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\\n\\tcommentary\\'\\' on the code, as well as the full text.  That\\'s the\\n\\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there\\'s no handbook for\\n\\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\\n\\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\\n\\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\\n\\n\\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\\n\\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\\n\\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\\n\\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\\n\\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\\n\\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\\n\\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\\n\\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\\n\\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\\n\\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\\n\\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\\n\\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\\n\\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\\n\\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\\n\\n\\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\\n\\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\\n\\tOntario, it\\'s Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn\\'t\\n\\toverly fat.  It\\'s about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\\n\\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\\n\\tequivalent NEC publications.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\\n\\tthe province.\\n\\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\\n\\n\\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\\n\\tIn some, they\\'re not.  Check with your local electrical\\n\\tinspector.  Most places won\\'t permit you to do wiring on other\\'s\\n\\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\\n\\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\\n\\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\\n\\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\\n\\twiring if you\\'re supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\\n\\tfind one willing to supervise.\\n\\n\\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\\n\\n\\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\\n\\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it\\'s your own home,\\n\\tand it\\'s you or your family that might get killed if you make\\n\\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\\n\\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\\n\\tIn this FAQ we\\'ve consciously given a few recommendations that\\n\\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it\\'s reasonable,\\n\\tand will impress the inspector.\\n\\n\\tThe inspector will know that you\\'re an amateur.  You have to\\n\\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\\n\\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don\\'t cut corners.\\n\\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\\n\\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t try to hide anything from the inspector.\\n\\n\\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don\\'t use a bread knife to strip\\n\\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\\n\\twon\\'t like it, and the results won\\'t be that safe.  And it\\n\\ttakes longer.  And you\\'re more likely to stick a hunk of\\n\\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t handle house wire when it\\'s very cold (eg: below -10C\\n\\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\\n\\tbecome very brittle.\\n\\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\\n\\n\\tFirst, there\\'s the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\\n\\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you\\'re \\n\\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\\n\\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\\n\\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\\n\\n\\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\\n\\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you\\'re doing a lot, or\\n\\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\\n\\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\\n\\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\\n\\tyou through, so they\\'re much faster and less fatiguing, even\\n\\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\\n\\n\\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\\n\\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\\n\\twork well).\\n\\t\\n\\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\\n\\tordinary wire cutters.  Don\\'t buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\\n\\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\\n\\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\\n\\tstripping holes, and won\\'t nick or grab the wire - it should\\n\\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\\n\\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\\n\\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren\\'t\\n\\tnecessary, and pros usually don\\'t use them.\\n\\n\\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\\n\\tin constricted places.  Don\\'t use these for stripping wire.\\n\\n\\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\\n\\n\\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\\n\\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it\\'s better to form wire\\n\\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\\n\\taccurate.\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'re using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\\n\\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\\n\\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\\n\\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\\n\\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn\\'t try to strip\\n\\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it\\'s too easy to\\n\\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\\n\\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\\n\\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\\n\\tthat you\\'ll gouge the conductors.\\n\\n\\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it\\'s well\\n\\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\\n\\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\\n\\tor the insulation.\\n\\n\\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\\n\\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\\n\\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\\n\\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\\n\\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\\n\\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\\n\\n\\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\\n\\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\\n\\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\\n\\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I\\'ve been known\\n\\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\\n\\n\\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\\n\\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\\n\\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\\n\\n\\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\\n\\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\\n\\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \\n\\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\\n\\tscrews - I don\\'t do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\\n\\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\\n\\tthat has no cover plate).\\n\\nSubject: What is UL listing?\\n\\n\\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\\n\\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\\n\\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\\n\\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\\n\\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\\n\\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn\\'t necessarily\\n\\tmean that the device actually does what it\\'s supposed to, just\\n\\tthat it probably won\\'t kill you.\\n\\n\\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\\n\\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\\n\\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\\n\\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\\n\\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\\n\\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\\n\\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\\n\\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\\n\\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\\n\\toccupancy permits issued.\\n\\t\\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\\n\\n\\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\\n\\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\\n\\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\\n\\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\\n\\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\\n\\trequired by law.\\n\\n\\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\\n\\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\\n\\tclaim.\\n\\n\\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\\n\\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\\n\\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\\n\\tcompanies.\\n\\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\\n\\n\\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\\n\\n\\t    Residential Wiring\\n\\t    by Jeff Markell,\\n\\t    Craftsman Books,\\n\\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25.

Knight authors and publishes a book called\\n\\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\\n\\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\\n\\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\\n\\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY\\'ers.  It is better to get\\n\\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\\n\\tquestions on the net ;-).\\n\\n\\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\\n\\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\\n\\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\\n\\n\\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\\n\\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\\n\\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\\n\\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\\n\\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\\n\\tor subsequent owners of your home don\\'t get killed or lose\\n\\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\\n\\n\\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\\n\\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\\n\\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\\n\\tthis.\\n\\n\\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\\n\\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\\n\\tclaims.\\n\\n\\tIn general, the process goes like this:\\n\\t\\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\\n\\t\\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\\n\\t\\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\\n\\t\\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you\\'re not\\n\\t\\t  sure of.  If you\\'re doing major work, they may impose\\n\\t\\t  special conditions on you, require loading\\n\\t\\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\\n\\t\\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\\n\\t\\t- If you\\'re installing a main panel, you will need to\\n\\t\\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\\n\\t\\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\\n\\t\\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\\n\\t\\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\\n\\t\\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\\n\\t\\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\\n\\t\\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\\n\\t\\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\\n\\t\\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".\\n\\nSubject: My house doesn\\'t meet some of these rules and regulations.\\n\\tDo I have to upgrade?\\n\\n\\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\\n\\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\\n\\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\\n\\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major\\'\\' work, you\\n\\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\\n\\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\\n\\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\\n\\n\\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\\n\\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\\n\\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\\n\\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\\n\\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\\n\\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\\n\\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\\n\\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it\\'s not\\n\\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\\n\\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\\n\\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\\n\\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\\n\\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\\n\\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\\n\\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\\n\\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\\n\\n\\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\\n\\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\\n\\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\\n\\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\\n\\tlow.\\n\\n\\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\\n\\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\\n\\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\\n\\tcircuit that\\'s 277V from hot to neutral.\\n\\n\\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\\n\\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\\n\\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\\n\\n\\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\\n\\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\\n\\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\\n\\n \\tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\\n \\tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\\n \\tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\\n\\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\\n\\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\\n\\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\\n\\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\\n\\tnormally carries no current.\\n\\n\\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\\n\\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\\n\\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\\n\\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\\n\\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\\n\\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\\n\\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\\n\\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\\n\\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\\n\\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\\n\\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\\n\\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\\n\\n\\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\\n\\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\\n\\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\\n\\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \\n\\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\\n\\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\\n\\tinspector.\\n\\n\\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\\n\\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\\n\\twell.\\n\\n\\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\\n\\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\\n\\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\\n\\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\\n\\n\\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\\n\\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\\n\\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\\n\\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\\n\\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\\n\\tservice).\\n\\nSubject: What is a circuit?\\n\\n\\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\\n\\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\\n\\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\\n\\t\\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\\n\\t\\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\\n\\t\\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\\n\\t\\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\\n\\n\\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\\n\\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\\n\\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\\n\\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\\n\\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\\n\\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\\n\\tair conditioners.\\n\\n\\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\\n\\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\\n\\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\\n\\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\\n\\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\\n\\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\\n\\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\\n\\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\\n\\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\\n\\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\\n\\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\\n\\tpermissible.]\\n\\n\\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\\n\\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\\n\\n\\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\\n\\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\\n\\n\\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\\n\\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\\n\\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\\n\\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\\n\\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\\n\\n\\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\\n\\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\\n\\n\\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\\n\\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\\n\\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\\n\\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\\n\\talternative to GFCI protection.\\n\\nSubject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\\n\\n\\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\\n\\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\\n\\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\\n\\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\\n\\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\\n\\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\\n\\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\\n\\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\\n\\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\\n\\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\\n\\ttogether in the panel.\\n\\n\\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\\n\\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\\n\\n\\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\\n\\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\\n\\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\\n\\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\\n\\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\\n\\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\\n\\n\\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\\n\\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\\n\\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\\n\\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\\n\\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\\n\\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\\n\\tequipment itself won\\'t cause a fire.\\n\\n\\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\\n\\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\\n\\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\\n\\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\\n\\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\\n\\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\\n\\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\\n\\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\\n\\treplaced.\\n\\n\\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\\n\\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\\n\\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\\n\\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\\n\\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\\n\\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\\n\\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\\n\\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\\n\\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\\n\\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\\n\\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\\n\\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\\n\\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\\n\\tpurpose.\\n\\n\\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\\n\\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\\n\\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\\n\\tcan often cause severe damage.\\n\\nSubject: Breakers?  Can\\'t I use fuses?\\n\\n\\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\\n\\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\\n\\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\\n\\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\\n\\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\\n\\tpenny\" trick.\\n\\n\\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\\n\\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\\n\\n\\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\\n\\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\\n\\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\\n\\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\\n\\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\\n\\tBreakers don\\'t do this.\\n\\n\\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\\n\\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\\n\\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\\n\\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\\n\\n\\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\\n\\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\\n\\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\\n\\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\\n\\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\\n\\tif you need one.\\n\\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\\n\\n\\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\\n\\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\\n\\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\\n\\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\\n\\t14 gauge, though it\\'s stiffer and harder to work with.\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\\n\\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\\n\\tganged with other wires in a place where they can\\'t dissipate\\n\\theat easily:\\n\\n\\t\\tGauge\\t\\tAmps\\n\\t\\t14\\t\\t15\\n\\t\\t12\\t\\t20\\n\\t\\t10\\t\\t30\\n\\t\\t8\\t\\t40\\n\\t\\t6\\t\\t65\\n\\t\\n\\tWe don\\'t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\\n\\ton the application and precise wire type.\\n\\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\\n\\n\\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\\n\\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\\n\\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\\n\\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\\n\\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\\n\\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\\n\\truns.\\n\\n\\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\\n\\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\\n\\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\\n\\tlamps.  Don\\'t try this unless you\\'re certain that your use fits\\n\\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\\n\\twire.\\n\\nSubject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\\n\\n\\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\\n\\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\\n\\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\\n\\tremember there\\'s usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\\n\\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\\n\\n\\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\\n\\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\\n\\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\\n\\n\\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\\n\\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\\n\\nSubject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\\n\\tused?\\n\\n\\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that\\'s used\\n\\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\\n\\tare trade names.  You\\'ll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\\n\\n\\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\\n\\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\\n\\n\\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don\\'t need to twist the\\n\\twire, do it anyways - it\\'s more mechanically and electrically\\n\\tsecure.\\n\\n\\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\\n\\tthat the wire nut you\\'re using is the correct size for the\\n\\tquantity and sizes of wire you\\'re connecting together.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\\n\\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\\n\\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\\n\\tit\\'s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\\n\\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\\n\\n\\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\\n\\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\\n\\ttear it off during an inspection.  It\\'s usually done because\\n\\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\\n\\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\\n\\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\\n\\n\\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter\\'\\'.  It measures\\n\\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\\n\\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\\n\\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\\n\\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\\n\\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\\n\\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\\n\\tthe circuit.\\n\\n\\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\\n\\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\\n\\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\\n\\twouldn\\'t help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\\n\\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\\n\\tGFCI happy.\\n\\n\\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\\n\\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\\n\\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\\n\\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\\n\\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\\n\\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\\n\\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\\n\\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6\\' of the sink, garages,\\n\\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\\n\\tjust about anywhere else where you\\'re likely to encounter water\\n\\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\\n\\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space\\'\\',\\n\\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\\n\\tlaundry appliances.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\\n\\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\\n\\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\\n\\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they\\'re near the door to\\n\\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\\n\\n\\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\\n\\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\\n\\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\\n\\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\\n\\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\\n\\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\\n\\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\\n\\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\\n\\nSubject: Where shouldn\\'t I use a GFCI?\\n\\n\\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don\\'t pose a\\n\\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\\n\\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\\n\\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\\n\\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\\n\\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\\n\\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\\n\\tGFCI trips are real; if you\\'re getting a lot of trips for no\\n\\tapparent reason, you\\'d be well-advised to check your wiring\\n\\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\\n\\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\\n\\n\\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\\n\\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\\n\\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\\n\\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\\n\\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\\n\\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\\n\\tcircuit\\'\\' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\\n\\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you\\'ll need a\\n\\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\\n\\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\\n\\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\\n\\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\\n\\n\\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\\n\\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\\n\\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You\\'ll thank yourself for it.\\n\\n\\tIncidentally, if you\\'re installing a GFCI to ensure that one\\n\\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don\\'t\\n\\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\\n\\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\\n\\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\\n\\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\\n\\n\\tWhen you install a GFCI, it\\'s a good idea to use the little\\n\\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\\n\\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\\n\\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\\n\\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\\n\\nSubject: What\\'s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\\n\\n\\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won\\'t comment on,\\n\\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won\\'t turn on without\\n\\ta good ground connection), they\\'re intended to guard against\\n\\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\\n\\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there\\'s an\\n\\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\\n\\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\\n\\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\\n\\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\\n\\tyou touch it while you\\'re grounded, you\\'ll get zapped.  Of\\n\\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\\n\\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\\n\\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\\n\\n\\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\\n\\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\\n\\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\\n\\telectrode in a toaster, and you\\'re not grounded, nothing will\\n\\thappen.  If you\\'re slightly grounded, you\\'ll get a small shock;\\n\\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\\n\\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you\\'d be the perfect path to\\n\\tground...\\n\\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\\n\\n\\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\\n\\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\\n\\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\\n\\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\\n\\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\\n\\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\\n\\n\\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\\n\\n\\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\\n\\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\\n\\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\\n\\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\\n\\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\\n\\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\\n\\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\\n\\tcircuits\\'\\' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\\n\\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\\n\\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\\n\\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\\n\\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\\n\\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\\n\\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\\n\\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6\\' of a sink *must* be\\n\\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\\n\\n\\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\\n\\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\\n\\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\\n\\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\\n\\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\\n\\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\\n\\tconnection fall off doesn\\'t cause the neutral to disconnect\\n\\tfrom downstream outlets.\\n\\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\\n\\n\\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\\n\\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\\n\\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\\n\\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\\n\\n\\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\\n\\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\\n\\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\\n\\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\\n\\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\\n\\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\\n\\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\\n\\n\\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\\n\\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\\n\\tfairly resistant to damage.\\n\\n\\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\\n\\tsheath.\\n\\t\\n\\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\\n\\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\\n\\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\\n\\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\\n\\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\\n\\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\\n\\n\\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\\n\\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\\n\\tbut this is technically illegal.]\\n\\n\\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\\n\\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\\n\\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\\n\\tand CEC):\\n\\n\\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\\n\\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\\n\\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\\n\\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\\n\\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\\n\\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\\n\\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\\n\\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\\n\\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\\n\\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\\n\\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\\n\\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\\n\\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\\n\\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\\n\\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1\\' of every box\\n\\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5\\'.\\n\\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\\n\\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\\n\\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\\n\\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\\n\\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\\n\\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\\n\\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\\n\\t      in the breach...]\\n\\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\\n\\t      similar finish.\\n\\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\\n\\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\\n\\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\\n\\t      than 1m (39\").\\n\\n\\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\\n\\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\\n\\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\\n\\tthe insulation.\\n\\n\\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\\n\\tsolid wall coverings.\\n\\n\\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\\n\\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\\n\\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\\n\\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\\n\\twire.\\n\\n\\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\\n\\n\\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\\n\\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\\n\\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\\n\\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\\n\\twiring section.]\\n\\n \\tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\\n \\texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\\n \\tpurpose.\\n\\n\\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\\n\\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\\n\\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\\n\\tis that if there\\'s a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\\n\\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\\n\\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\\n\\t\\n \\tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\\n \\texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\\n \\ttemperature rating in Celsius.

The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\\n\\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\\n\\tboxes don\\'t use metal cable clamps.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\\n\\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\\n\\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\\n\\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\\n\\n\\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\\n\\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\\n\\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\\n\\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\\n\\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\\n\\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\\n\\n\\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\\n\\n\\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they\\'re accessible\\n\\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\\n\\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\\n\\tget nasty.\\n\\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\\n\\n\\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\\n\\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\\n\\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\\n\\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\\n\\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\\n\\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\\n\\twiring doesn\\'t have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\\n\\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\\n\\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\\n\\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\\n\\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\\n\\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\\n\\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\\n\\n\\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\\n\\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\\n\\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\\n\\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\\n\\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\\n\\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\\n\\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\\n\\tmounted between the joists.\\n\\n\\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\\n\\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\\n\\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\\n\\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\\n\\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\\n\\t8\\'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\\n\\twith plywood) that doesn\\'t have any insulation.  (Yes, that\\'s 8 *feet*\\n\\tlong)\\n\\n\\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\\n\\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\\n\\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\\n\\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin\\'\\' might be worthwhile.\\n\\tPresumably, that\\'s up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn\\'t\\n\\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\\n\\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can\\'t get\\n\\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\\n\\tin later.]\\n\\n\\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\\n\\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\\n\\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\\n\\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\\n\\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\\n\\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\\n\\tfor the sensor can vary.\\n\\n\\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\\n\\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.\\n\\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\\n\\n\\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\\n\\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\\n\\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\\n\\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\\n\\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\\n\\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\\n\\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\\n\\n\\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\\n\\tand have them come and check out the problem.\\n\\n\\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\\n\\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\\n\\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\\n\\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\\n\\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\\n\\n\\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\\n\\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\\n\\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\\n\\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\\n\\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\\n\\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\\n\\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\\n\\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\\n\\n\\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\\n\\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\\n\\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\\n\\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\\n\\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\\n\\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\\n\\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\\n\\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\\n\\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop\\'\\' has an\\n\\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\\n\\n\\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\\n\\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\\n\\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\\n\\n\\tTheoretically, it doesn\\'t make any difference.  However, there\\n\\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\\n\\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\\n\\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\\n\\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\\n\\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\\n\\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\\n\\n\\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\\n\\tthan 50 feet long.\\n\\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\\n\\n\\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\\n\\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\\n\\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\\n\\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\\n\\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\\n\\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\\n\\n\\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\\n\\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\\n\\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\\n\\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\\n\\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\\n\\tWhat they don\\'t mention is that if you kept it in that\\n\\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\\n\\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it\\'s drawing far\\n\\tmore current than it can continuously.\\n\\n\\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\\n\\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can\\'t find that figure,\\n\\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\\n\\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\\n\\n\\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\\n\\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\\n\\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\\n\\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\\n\\n\\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\\n\\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\\n\\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\\n\\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\\n\\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\\n\\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\\n\\t       it\\'s continuous to the main house ground point, you can\\n\\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\\n\\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\\n\\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\\n\\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\\n\\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\\n\\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\\n\\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\\n\\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\\n\\t       wouldn\\'t be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\\n\\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\\n\\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren\\'t\\n\\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\\n\\t       on BX cable.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\\n\\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\\n\\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\\n\\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\\n\\tShould the test button work?\\n\\n\\tWe\\'re sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\\n\\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there\\'s\\n\\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\\n\\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\\n\\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\\n\\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn\\'t require\\n\\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\\n\\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\\n\\tif the test button doesn\\'t work, something\\'s broken, and potentially\\n\\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\\n\\n\\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\\n\\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\\n\\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\\n\\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\\n\\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\\n\\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\\n\\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\\n\\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\\n\\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\\n\\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\\n\\tit, and promised to investigate.)\\n\\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\\n\\n\\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\\n\\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\\n\\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\\n\\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\\n\\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\\n\\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\\n\\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\\n\\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\\n\\twhich means you\\'d have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\\n\\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\\n\\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\\n\\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\\n\\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\\n\\tRPM, while you\\'re groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\\n\\n\\tDo install lots of outlets.  It\\'s easier to install them in the\\n\\tbeginning, when you don\\'t have to cut into an existing cable.\\n\\tIt\\'s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\\n\\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\\n\\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\\n\\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\\n\\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\\n\\twrong.\\n\\n\\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\\n\\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\\n\\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\\n\\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\\n\\n\\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\\n\\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\\n\\tDon\\'t overload circuits, and don\\'t use extension cords if you\\n\\tcan help it, unless they\\'re rated for high currents.  (A coiled\\n\\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\\n\\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won\\'t withstand as much\\n\\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\\n\\n\\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\\n\\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\\n\\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\\n\\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\\n\\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe\\'\\'\\n\\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\\n\\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\\n\\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\\n\\t``horsepower-rated\\'\\' switches instead.\\n\\n\\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\\n\\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\\n\\teven if you ``know\\'\\' that you\\'d never use one of your shop\\n\\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\\n\\thave a different idea.\\n\\n\\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\\n\\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\\n\\nSubject: Underground Wiring\\n\\n\\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\\n\\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\\n\\ttubing and possibly lumber (don\\'t use creosoted lumber, it rots\\n\\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\\n\\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\\n\\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\\n\\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\\n\\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\\n\\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\\n\\tof course, don\\'t forget the GFCIs.\\n\\n\\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\\n\\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\\n\\tyour specific situation.\\n\\n\\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\\n\\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\\n\\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\\n\\n\\tDuring the 1970\\'s, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\\n\\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\\n\\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\\n\\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\\n\\tWe recommend, even if you\\'re allowed to, that do not use it for new\\n\\twiring.\\n\\n\\tBut don\\'t panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\\n\\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\\n\\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\\n\\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\\n\\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\\n\\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\\n\\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\\n\\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\\n\\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\\n\\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\\n\\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\\n\\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\\n\\tmelt the insulation or fixture it\\'s attached to, and possibly even\\n\\tcause a fire.\\n\\n\\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\\n\\tinto a house built during the 70\\'s, we will cover basic points of\\n\\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you\\'re considering purchasing\\n\\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\\n\\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\\n\\tfor the following things:\\n\\n\\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\\n\\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\\n\\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\\n\\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\\n\\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\\n\\n\\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\\n\\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\\n\\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\\n\\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\\n\\t       up each connection.\\n\\n\\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\\n\\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\\n\\n\\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\\n\\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\\n\\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\\n\\n\\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\\n\\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\\n\\t       be repaired.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\\n\\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\\n\\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\\n\\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\\n\\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\\n\\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\\n\\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\\n\\t       you can rent the tool.\\n\\n\\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\\n\\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\\n\\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\\n    \\n\\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\\n\\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\\n\\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\\n\\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\\n\\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\\n\\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\\n\\tYou can do this yourself too.\\n\\nSubject: I\\'m buying a house!  What should I do?\\n\\n\\tCongratulations.  But...  It\\'s generally a good idea to hire\\n\\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\\n\\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\\n\\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\\n\\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\\n\\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\\n\\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s some hints on what to look for:\\n\\n\\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\\n\\n\\t\\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\\n\\t\\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\\n\\t\\t  proper marking.\\n\\t\\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\\n\\t\\t  a GFCI)\\n\\t\\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\\n\\t\\t- Switched neutrals\\n\\t\\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\\n\\n\\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\\n\\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\\n\\n\\t\\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\\n\\t\\t   not properly terminated wiring)\\n\\t\\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\\n\\t\\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\\n\\t\\t  it\\'s *really* convenient ;-)\\n\\t\\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\\n\\t\\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\\n\\t\\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\\n\\t\\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\\n\\t\\t  ceiling\\n\\t\\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\\n\\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\\n\\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\\n\\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \\n\\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\\n\\n\\tThe oldest wiring system you\\'re likely to encounter is called\\n\\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\\n\\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\\n\\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\\n\\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\\n\\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\\n\\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\\n\\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\\n\\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\\n\\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\\n\\tcases K&T isn\\'t colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\\n\\tcolour as the hot wires.\\n\\n\\tYou\\'ll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40\\'s.\\n\\n\\tComments on K&T:\\n\\n\\t\\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\\n\\t\\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\\n\\t\\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\\n\\t\\t  very well.  Most K&T I\\'ve seen, for example, is in\\n\\t\\t  quite good condition.\\n\\t\\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\\n\\t\\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\\n\\t\\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\\n\\t\\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\\n\\t\\t- Sometimes the neutral isn\\'t balanced very well between\\n\\t\\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\\n\\t\\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\\n\\t\\t  any circuit.\\n\\t\\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\\n\\t\\t  that contain K&T.\\n\\t\\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\\n\\t\\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\\n\\t\\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\\n\\t\\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\\n\\t\\n\\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn\\'t\\n\\tnecessary to replace it simply because it\\'s K&T.  What you should\\n\\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\\n\\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it\\'s perfectly\\n\\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\\n\\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\\n\\t\\n\\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\\n\\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\\n\\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\\n\\tused in the 40\\'s and 50\\'s.  Again, no grounding conductor.\\n\\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\\n\\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We\\'ve seen whole\\n\\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\\n\\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\\n\\n\\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\\n\\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\\n\\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\\n\\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\\n\\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\\n\\ttubing.\\n\\n\\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\\n\\tIt\\'s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\\n\\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn\\'t present a hazard\\n\\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\\n\\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\\n\\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don\\'t abuse it too much.\\n\\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\\n\\n\\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\\n\\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\\n\\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\\n\\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\\n\\tknow what you\\'re talking about.

The most recent\\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\\npolice.\"2\\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960\\'s  the  female\\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\\n \\n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\\n1986\\n-------\\n\\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

Strictly,\\na 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change\\nstate, according to the inputs.\\n\\nA demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which\\nof four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are\\nthree inputs required.\\n\\nA decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable\\ninput, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all\\noutputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output\\nwill be low).\\n\\nAn eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to\\nselect which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your\\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\\n\\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\\nfour enable lines.\\n\\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\\nfour final stage decoders.\\n\\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\",\n",

The keywords `Monthly Posting\\'\\nwill always appear to make killing this article easy for users of\\nnewsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos\\ngroups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don\\'t\\nunderstand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at\\nleast for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please\\nsubscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the\\ndocumentation provided there.\\n\\nIntroduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:\\n\\nrec.autos.tech\\n\\nis intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,\\nconstruction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely\\ninappropriate, especially For Sale ads.\\n\\nrec.autos.sport\\n\\nis intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving\\nautomobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply\\nto competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,\\nspectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are\\nlargely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are\\ninappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.\\nDiscussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid\\nadvocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)\\n\\nrec.autos.driving\\n\\nis intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.\\nAlso, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert\\nyour pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.\\n\\nrec.autos.vw\\n\\nis intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership\\nof automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,\\nSeats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing\\nlist was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence\\nof this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many\\ndifferent marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be\\ncreated on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as\\na mailing list.\\n\\nrec.audio.car\\n\\nis not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,\\nthe correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and\\nso is mentioned here.\\n\\nrec.autos.antique\\n\\nis intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years\\nold, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)\\n\\nalt.hotrod\\n\\nis not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the\\nrec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing\\nlist, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing\\nperformance vehicles.\\n\\nalt.autos.rod-n-custom\\n\\nalso not part of the `official\\' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar\\nAmerican hobby of customizing older cars.\\n\\nalt.autos.karting\\n\\nfor the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.\\n\\nrec.autos\\n\\nis intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.\\n\\n\\nCrossposting:\\n\\nCrossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on\\nthe Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear\\nin all of the newsgroups listed.\\n\\nCrossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on\\nUsenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is\\nappropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular\\naudience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector\\narticles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are\\nalmost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact\\nthat you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or\\nrec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.\\n\\nCrossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually\\ninappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is\\ntruly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:\\nto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.\\n\\nCrossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in\\nparticular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of\\nradar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.\\n\\nMost readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn\\'t care less about\\nthe police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in\\nrec.autos.\\n\\nIt is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of\\narticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to\\nmisc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these\\nthree.  The life you save may be your own.\\n\\nDistribution:\\n\\nThere is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to\\n(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution\\nfield.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve\\nas a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.\\n\\nThe distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, \\nthe Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,\\nNew Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the\\nfollowing hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article\\nheaders, and on article content.\\n\\n1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford\\nMavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in\\neither place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange\\nreason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)\\n\\n2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which\\nyour car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences\\nbetween a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,\\nall 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel\\ninjection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These\\ndifferences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.\\nFailure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant\\nspread of misinformation.\\n\\n3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;\\nin the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas\\nEurope is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition\\nof this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used\\nabbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos\\nreaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.\\n\\n4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when\\npossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can\\n(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state\\nabbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted\\nto send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put\\n\"ny,nj\" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated\\nvalues are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so\\nyou should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely\\nto be supported in your area.\\n\\nThe Dangers of Overgeneralization:\\n\\nTo amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:\\nBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is\\ntrue for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a\\n1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly\\ndifferent from those in Idaho.\\n\\nThe Need for Adequate Specification:\\n\\nWhen you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;\\ne.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,\\nmodel, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be\\nquite useless.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Lemons:\\n\\nAt one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or\\ntwo; even Honda admits to this.  Please don\\'t waste everyone\\'s time by\\nannouncing to the world that your `brand x\\' automobile is terrible, so all\\n`brand x\\' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from\\nthe `brand x\\' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they\\ncause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\nConcerning Flames:\\n\\nAs much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most\\nlikely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how\\nto deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section\\nof this posting):\\n\\nIf you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don\\'t imagine for a\\nminute that including the words `No Flames\\' will work.  It won\\'t, and\\nyou\\'ll get exactly what you deserve.\\n\\nIf you\\'re going to flame, you\\'re more likely to get away with it if you can\\ncite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe\\nbald, unsupported assertions.\\n\\nBe careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.\\n\\n\\nAsking the Question:\\n\\nIt is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please\\nsend email, I don\\'t read this group\\'.  It is a much better idea to\\nend the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest\\nI\\'ll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses\\nto this request\\'.\\n\\nAnswering the Question:\\n\\nIf someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don\\'t tell them to get a Mustang.\\nEither be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on\\ndefending a speeding ticket, don\\'t tell them to obey the law next time --\\nit\\'s offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn\\'t directly\\naddress the original question.  In general, don\\'t post in order to see\\nyour words in print, and don\\'t post in order to enjoy feeling smug and\\nself-righteous.\\n\\n\\nStale and/or Inflammatory Topics:\\n\\nCertain topics are considered stale by `old timers\\'; while discussion of\\nthem is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings\\nabout them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them\\nignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is\\ndifficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some\\nof these topics include the following:\\n\\n1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con\\n\\n2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of\\n    radar detectors.\\n\\n3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.\\n\\n4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why\\n    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car\\' group -- everyone would argue\\n    about what constitutes a `sports car\\'.)\\n\\n5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver\\'s\\n    right to own and operate a radar detector\\n\\n6)  `Buy American\\' discussions\\n\\n7)  `clever\\' bumper stickers and personalized license plates\\n\\n8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible\\n\\n9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?\\n      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the\\n          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.\\n          Until then, please don\\'t waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease direct comments and suggestions about this article to:\\n\\n     welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n-- \\nrichard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com\\n``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of\\n  a race car about either its pitch or roll axis\\'\\'  -- Carroll Smith\\n',\n",

I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it\\nwas well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions\\nit in his song \"Black Day in July\".\\n  --------------------------------------------------\\n\\n  Since you don\\'t dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that\\nmeans I was right.  \\n\\n: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the \\'67\\n: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\\n: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.

I would know about\\n: it. \\n\\n   Glad to know you\\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\\nauthority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\\nhad happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\\nauthority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\\nmassive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\\nSome claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\\nthe Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I\\'ve also\\nheard some things about that but I won\\'t dare repeat them.  You\\'d\\nassert that I claimed they were truth.\\n\\n: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\n\\n   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \\ndifference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \\nyears ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\\nSo it would have been an Army cover-up.\\n\\n   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\\nwere burnt, some were in rubble.

And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\n: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\\n\\n   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\\'m quite willing to believe\\nthat they did fire their guns.\\n\\n   Now then, we\\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\\nthis far and all you\\'ve managed to say is that you don\\'t believe the\\naccount I cited.\\n\\n: --John L.
